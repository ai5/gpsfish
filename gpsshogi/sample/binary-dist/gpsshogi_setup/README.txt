======

The `single' and `smp' directories contain binaries running on a single core or multiple cores respectively.

The `smp' version is recommended to run on a machine with 4GB RAM, and can concurrently use at most two cores since 32-bit versions of Windows can consume up to 4GB in a normal way. 

If your machine has less RAM (even on a multiple-core processor), you may give a try of the `single' version.
